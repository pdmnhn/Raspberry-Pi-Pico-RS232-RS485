# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-RS232-RS485

In this project, our objective is to send process data read by ADC from photoresistor with a microcontroller, here we used Raspberry Pi Pico to another microcontroller, here also we used Raspberry Pi Pico via Serial Communication UART with RS232 or RS485 communication standards.
We have used both RS232 and RS485. We have displayed the data received in a 16x2 LCD display module. For more about the project, kindly go throught the project report in this repo.
